# Billionaire
If someone reads this, then my condolences to you and please do not beat me, because there are almost no comments in the code, and the word refactoring was only heard once. But after some time and a certain number of projects, I see these shortcomings, places where it was necessary to do otherwise, you already know the built-in mechanisms in Unity that you did not know about before and had to "shit-code". 
Isn't this a sign of growth and a reason to leave everything as it is, as a reminder of what I started and what I wrote?< - great way to avoid refactoring :)
